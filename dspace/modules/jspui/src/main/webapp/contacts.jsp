    <h2>ANU Research</h2>
	<p>The ANU Research repository contains two collections:</p>
	
	<h3>Open Access Research</h3> 
	<p>(<a href="https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/26">https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/26</a>)
	holds open access versions of journal articles, conference papers, book chapters, working and discussion papers plus recordings of relevant talks and other research output.</p>

	<h3>The ANU Digital Theses Collection</h3> 
	<p>(<a href="https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/3">https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/3</a>) holds the open access version of those ANU
	PhD and Masters theses that graduates have chosen to make available for further research.</p>

	<p>If you have any questions about these collections, or are having trouble finding or accessing an item, send your query to <a href="mailto:repository.admin@anu.edu.au">repository.admin@anu.edu.au</a>. 
	Don't forget to include the handle (url) or name of the item you are having an issue with.</p>
	
	<h2>Research Collections</h2>
	<p>The images from the ANU Archives and the Noel Butlin Archives Centre are provided for research use. If you would like to purchase a high-resolution image for publication, please complete
	a ‘Request for copies’ form available <a href="http://nbac.anu.edu.au/using-the-archives/photography-service">here</a> and send to
	<a href="mailto:butlin.archives@anu.edu.au">butlin.archives@anu.edu.au</a>.</p>

	<p>We welcome any additional information about the images you may have. Please send an email to <a href="mailto:butlin.archives@anu.edu.au">butlin.archives@anu.edu.au</a>, quoting the handle number above the photograph
	(eg <code>http://hdl.handle.net/1885/48649</code>). 

	<h2>Items with restrictions</h2>
	<p>Generally all material in Digital Collections is available open access, with three exceptions:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Embargos - There are a few items which are held under embargo until we can make them available.</li>
		<li>Restrictions - A very small number of items have restrictions on their availability.</li>
		<li>High resolution images - see <strong>Research Collections</strong> above for information on how to purchase these images.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Registering for Digital Collections</h2>
	<p>Most users will not need to register for Digital Collections. Some restricted items may become available if a user registers and logs in, but we recommend contacting us at <a href="mailto:repository.admin@anu.edu.au">repository.admin@anu.edu.au</a>
	first if you are having trouble opening an item.</p>
