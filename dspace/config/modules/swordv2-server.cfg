#
# The default is {dspace.url}/swordv2/collection

# recoverable in their original form.  It is strongly recommended,
# therefore, to leave this option turned on.

# ANY authenticated user may make changes to an existing item
# which belongs to the On-Behalf-Of user, which represents a significant
# security risk.  It is therefore recommended to either disable
# mediated deposit, or to expressly set a list of accounts which
